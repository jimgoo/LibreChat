Choose Your Horizon is a team of mental health specialists based out of Austin, Texas that provides virtual consultations and therapy sessions. When other treatments have failed to work, we give people in need access to ketamine assisted psychotherapy. Choose Your Horizon's mission is to empower people to regain their happiness through ketamine assisted therapy that is delivered in an equitable way.

Choose Your Horizon's clinicians may prescribe ketamine assisted therapy for indications of depression or anxiety. Ketamine is a prescription medication that doctors can prescribe off-label to treat depression, anxiety, chronic pain, PTSD, OCD, and other mental health-related conditions.

Ketamine is an FDA approved drug used in the hospital daily. Over the last 50 years, doctors have discovered multiple uses for ketamine in mental health conditions. In fact, the evidence is so strong the American Psychiatric Association put out a statement saying that the antidepressant effects of ketamine are both rapid and robust.

At-home ketamine therapy begins with an online assessment and video consultation with a psychiatric nurse practitioner. If our medical team determines you’re a fit for this kind of therapy you'll be prescribed oral ketamine and schedule your first virtual appointment. During the initial appointment you'll prepare with your therapy guide and undergo your first ketamine treatment.

Based on your response, the medical team will provide a personalized plan for your follow up sessions. Throughout your treatment, you'll use Choose Your Horizon's online platform to help prepare for your sessions, explore your inner mind and integrate your experiences into your daily life.

Ketamine has a dissociative effect. This means that it creates a separation of mind and body, also commonly referred to as an out of body experience. While ketamine is not a true psychedelic, it does have psychedelic properties and creates an altered state of consciousness, allowing the mind to be outside of its normal waking status. In this state, the mind can access subconscious information.

Ketamine is a powerful disruptor of limiting beliefs around ourselves and our world, allowing one to see themselves truly without all the labels and limitations. It often creates a euphoric feeling for people and many people report having a sense of oneness and connectedness to others and to something bigger than themselves. Ketamine can also allow people to revisit times or memories of trauma and reconsolidate the memories around those events in a less painful, fearful or traumatic way.

Choose Your Horizon was created for anyone seeking to take control over their anxiety or depression. Whether you're looking to enhance your current treatments or other treatments haven’t provided relief, Choose Your Horizon can help develop a treatment plan specifically for you.

Although many people are good candidates, ketamine assisted therapy isn't for everyone. Choose Your Horizon always puts the patient's health first and treatment decisions are made at our clinician’s discretion.

Choose Your Horizon's clinicians are licensed by the relevant governing professional board or organization in the states where they practice. You can learn more about our medical team by visiting https://www.chooseketamine.com/medical-team.

Ketamine is a legal medication, originally used for anesthesia. It was developed in the 1960s and was commonly used in the Vietnam war because it could be used in the field safely and effectively. Ketamine does not suppress the respiratory drive or paralyze muscles the way other anesthetics do, and its dissociative properties provide for rapid pain relief.

Ketamine has been used in mental health for more than 20 years, and as a result we know the medicine itself is extremely safe for most individuals. Ketamine is FDA approved for anesthesia and treating depression. It’s also used as an off-label medication for pain and a variety of mental health conditions.

Recently, the FDA approved a specific form of intranasal ketamine to be used for the indication of treatment resistant depression (TRD). TRD does not have an agreed upon definition but typically refers to people who have had an inadequate response from at least two antidepressant medications. Using this definition, TRD is relatively common given that 50% or more of patients do not achieve an adequate response following antidepressant therapy.

Ketamine can be used safely with many antidepressant medications. Always discuss medication plans with your primary physician to determine if any adverse effects may be possible. You can also discuss your options with the clinical team at Choose Your Horizon.

Choose Your Horizon provides professional guides as support for the first two sessions of every Ketamine treatment package. Sessions 3-6 are self-guided with a 15 minute check-in with our guide at the start. The guide will help you prepare for the experience and check that your peer is present. We do offer the opportunity to continue to work with our guides during these experiences for $80 per experience.

Important Reminders:
- Make sure to create some space before and after your session to clarify your intentions and journal.
- You must have a peer treatment monitor present and available for a quick check-in with your guide prior to your session.
- Don’t eat within 3 hours or drink within 1 hour prior to treatment to help avoid the slight risk of nausea or a bathroom break that interrupts your experience.
- As a reminder, you've committed not to drive a vehicle until the next day and you've had a full night of sleep.

Feel free to contact us anytime at: hello@chooseketamine.com. We have mental health professionals available to speak with you should you need additional support.

Returning patients can purchase an additional treatment plan for 30% off. Once you purchase a new plan, you have to finish your current plan before you can start on the new one.
